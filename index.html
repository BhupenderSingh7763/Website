        <h2>Hello Everyone.</h2>
        <p>I am a student at Delhi Technological University. I am persuing my Bachelor of Technology Degree from there in the field Mathematics and Computing Engineering. I have recently started to learn Web Development under Angela Yu at Udemy.</p>

          <h3>Batting</h3>
          <p>I like to bat but am not that good to be fair. I enjoy batting when I just have to make quickfire runs which tells you I am not that great at defence. I tend to learn a lot about cricket but my family is not that supportive when it comes to sports.</p>

          <h3>Bowling</h3>
          <p>I would describe myself as a bowling allrounder if someone wants me to specify that. The reason behind that is I find bowling skill to be superior than batting. A bowler needs to test all his skills while bowling each and every delivery which makes me fascinated more and more about it.</p>

          <h3>Fielding</h3>
          <p>I consider myself as a very safe fielder, and the best part about my fielding I guess is that I can field at any part of the ground, either be it slips, outfield or even wicketkeeping. I am safe as houses as my friends use to say.</p>
